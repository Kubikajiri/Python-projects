print (3**2) # power
print(8//3) # since normal division returns a float, "//" chops off all the decimal numbers, but doesnt round it

# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
